# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** Local-first, source-agnostic-ready, agentic knowledge layer over your Obsidian notes — with the memory namespace as a non-negotiable safety invariant.
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — Foundation & decisions

## Current Position

Phase: 00 (Foundation & decisions) — EXECUTING
Plan: 14 of 15 complete (Waves 1-5 done; Wave 6 sign-off next)
Status: Executing Phase 00 — adversarial review dispositioned (6 amend / 4 defer-v3), 397 tests green, lints clean
Last activity: 2026-05-14 -- Wave 5 complete: ADRs 001/002/003 amended per findings 1/2/4/7/9/10; findings 3/5/6/8 deferred to v3

Progress: [█████████░] 93%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Fold brief's Phase 4 (authority/staleness) into Phase 3 (bundles) — shared result shape
- Roadmap: Insert Phase 9 as hard premise-check gate before any v3 Notion work
- Roadmap: Defer brief's Phase 10 (Notion connector) to v3.0.0 — listed as deferred milestone, not active phase
- Roadmap: Renumber sequentially 0–9 to avoid confusion (brief's 4 folded, brief's 9.5 → 9)
- Phase 0: Expand from 6 brief-deliverables to 14 (ADR relocation, hash-semantics amendment, v1 eval baseline, tool-snapshot tests, fixture-privacy + telemetry CI lints, adversarial ADR review)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- ~~Phase 0: ADRs 001–004 currently gitignored at `docs/dev/`; first Phase 0 PR must relocate them to public `docs/v2/adr/`~~ — resolved Wave 2/3, all four ADRs now Accepted at `docs/v2/adr/`
- ~~Phase 2: ADR-004 amendment (folder vs separate-vault) must land before implementation~~ — resolved in plan 00-05 (folder-default + sentinel)
- Phase 5: ADR on LLM strategy (MCP Sampling → Ollama → caller-text ladder) must land before implementation
- Phase 7: Spike outcome (file-watcher vs full Obsidian plugin) decides scope; descope path to "Canvas as view, YAML as authoring" if spike fails
- Phase 0 follow-up: Alpine docker bake-test for CI lint scripts (00-12) — static review + telemetry red-test + suppression test passed locally; Alpine container POSIX run deferred (Docker daemon was unavailable). Re-verify before Phase 1.
